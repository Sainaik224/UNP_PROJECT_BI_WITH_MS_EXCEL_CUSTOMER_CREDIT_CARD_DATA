# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA

I developed a comprehensive and interactive Excel dashboard using credit card transaction data to analyze spending patterns, monitor transaction trends, and gain insights into customer behavior. Designed with a user-friendly layout, the dashboard incorporates dynamic features such as interactive charts, slicers, drop-down filters, and summary tables, allowing users to explore data seamlessly and derive actionable insights. It provides a detailed breakdown of spending categories—such as groceries, travel, and dining—enabling quick identification of high-expense areas. The dashboard also visualizes transaction volumes over time to uncover seasonal trends and detect unusual activity. In addition, it includes filters for customer segmentation based on attributes like location or account type, which enhances targeted analysis. To support fraud detection efforts, it highlights high-value or irregular transactions through conditional formatting and embedded logic, flagging potential anomalies such as inconsistent geographical activity or sudden spending spikes. By leveraging advanced Excel functionalities like PivotTables, dynamic formulas, and data validation, the dashboard empowers financial analysts and decision-makers with a powerful tool for data-driven financial monitoring and risk assessment.
